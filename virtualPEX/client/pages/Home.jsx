      <h1>Welcome to Virtual PEX!</h1>
      <p>Hello, and thank you for checkout out this virtual Picture Exchange Communication System (otherwise known as PECS or PEX). Virtual PEX was designed to work as an aide to parents, teachers or caregivers of children who are non-verbal or speech delayed as an alternative form of communication - giving children a visual represenation of the things around them so they can point at different items to make their wants or needs known.</p> 
      <p>So far, we have a database with over 275 words across many different categories. We hope to keep expanding this database in the future, and continue adding additional features - allowing users to create their own cards or update existing ones, allowing users to change the text-to-speech settings, stringing selected words together to allow children to start forming sentences, creating a user favorite section to store your child's most commonly used words and more. Come back in the future to see what's new! </p>
      <p>Our word database has been split into the different categories listed above. Simply select a category and click on an image - the seleced word will be read aloud! </p>
    </div>
